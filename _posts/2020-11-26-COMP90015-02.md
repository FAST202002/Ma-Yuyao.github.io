# Lecture 01：Introduction

## 1. Introduction
- Networks of computers are everywhere!
    1. Mobile phone networks -- GSM/3G networks, cell towers connect to backbones 
    2. Corporate networks(企业网络)-- LAN, consisting of PC’s, laptops, servers, storage, printing
    3. Factory networks -- Machines (drills, stamps, robots) communicate over network
    4. Campus networks -- Like CSSE Dept / Unimelb. Wired/wireless, clients, servers
    5. In-car networks -- Network of sensors (monitoring engine, breaks, tires etc)
    6. Internet of Things (IoT)
    7. On board networks in planes and trains
- This subject aims:
    1. to cover characteristics of networked/distributed computing systems and applications
    2. to present the main concepts and techniques that have been developed to help in the tasks of designing and implementing systems and applications that are based on networks.
- Node meaning in DS
    - the nodes are clients, servers or peers. A peer may sometimes serve as client, sometimes server.

## 2. Defining Distributed Systems

这里给出了3个人对于DS的不同定义
- > “A system in which hardware or software components（组件） located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by message passing.” ———— Coulouris
- > “A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the users of the system as a single computer.” ———— Tanenbaum
- > "A distributed system is one on which I cannot get any work done because some machine I have never heard of has crashed.“ ———— Leslie Lamport
- Example Distributed Systems:
	- Cluster:
		> “A type of parallel(平行的) or distributed processing system, which consists of a collection of interconnected stand-alone(独立的)  computers cooperatively working together as a single, integrated(集成的) computing resource” ———— Buyya (本课老师 Buyya 自己的定义)
	- Cloud: 
		> “a type of parallel and distributed system consisting of a collection of interconnected and virtualised computers that are dynamically provisioned(配置) and presented as one or more unified(统一的) computing resources based on service-level agreements established through negotiation between the service provider and consumers” ———— Buyya (本课老师 Buyya 自己的定义)

## 3. Networks vs. Distributed Systems
- Networks: A media for interconnecting local and wide area computers and exchange messages based on protocols(协议). Network entities(网络实体) are visible and they are explicitly(明确地) addressed (IP address).
	- These protocols are generally ‘well defined’, such as TCP/UDP over IP, IPX, NETBIOS.
	- In DS, much of the complexity is handled by the network layer, however we cannot assume everything is 100% reliable.
	- In DS, we operate at a higher level, but we must be mindful of the failures that can and will occur on Computer Networks.
- Distributed System: existence of multiple autonomous computers is transparent
- Many problems (e.g., openness, reliability) in common, but at different levels.
	1. Networks focuses on packets(包), routing(路由), etc., whereas distributed systems focus on applications.
	2. Every distributed system relies on services provided by a computer network.

## 4. Reasons for Distributed Systems

1. Functional Separation(分离)(功能分离):
    - Existence of computers with different capabilities and purposes:
     	- Clients and Servers
  		- Data collection and data processing
     	- Beneficial to separate collection from processing.
2. Inherent(固有) distribution:
    - Information:
  		- Different information is created and maintained by different people (e.g., Web pages)
    - People:
  		- Computer supported collaborative work (virtual teams, engineering, virtual surgery(手术))
    - Retail store and inventory(库存) systems for supermarket chains (e.g., Coles, Woolworths)
  	- The process/activity is naturally distributed
3. Power imbalance and load variation(变化):
    - Distribute computational load among different computers.
    - We are forced to use DS as one system cannot handle!
4. Reliability:
  	- Long term preservation(保存) and data backup(备份) (replication(复制)) at different locations.
  	- Government reg. may force us to retain data for 10 years
5. Economies:
  	- Sharing a printer by many users and reduce the cost of ownership.
  	- Building a supercomputer out of a network of computers.
    - Share resources, statistical multiplexing

## 5. Consequences(意义) of Distributed Systems
Computers in distributed systems may be on separate continents(大洲，大陆), in the same building, or the same room. DSs have the following consequences(意义):
**Consequencies are problems that need solving when we choose DS:**
1. Concurrency(并发) – each system is autonomous.
    - Carry out tasks independently
    - Tasks coordinate their actions by exchanging messages.
  
2. Heterogeneity(异质性)
    - **Heterogeneity** (that is, variety and difference) applies to all of the following:
     	- Hardware devices: computers, tablets, mobile phones, embedded(嵌入式的) devices, etc.
     	- Operating System: Ms Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, etc.
     	- Network: Local network, the Internet, wireless network, satellite(卫星) links, etc.
     	- Programming languages: Java, C/C++, Python, PHP, etc.
     	- Different roles of software developers, designers, system managers
		
        For example, In a distributed system, some computers can have linux os while others can have windows. Similarly, some can have intel processor whereas others may have arm processors.  They are referred to OS level and processor level heterogeneity. 
    
3. No global clock
  > A **logical clock** is a mechanism(机制) for capturing chronological(时序的) and causal(因果顺序的) relationships in a distributed system. Distributed systems may have no physically synchronous(同步的) global clock, so a logical clock allows global ordering on events from different processes in such systems.

  - In a distributed system there are as many clocks as there are systems. The clocks are coordinated to keep them somewhat consistent but no one clock has the exact time. Even if the clocks were some what in sync, the individual clocks on each component may run at a different rate or granularity(粒度) leading to them being out of sync only after one local clock cycle
  - Time is only known within a given precision(精度). At frequent intervals(间隔), a clock may synchronize with a more trusted clock. However, the clocks are not precisely the same because of time lapses(失误) due to transmission(传输) and execution(执行).
  - Consider a group of people going to a meeting. Each person has a watch. Each watch has a similar, but different time. Even with the error in time, the group is able to meet and conduct business. This is how distributed time works.
  - This is in contrast(对比) to a clock on a single system. Here there is only one clock and it provides a unified time for all sub components on this individual system.

## 6. Characteristics of Distributed Systems
1. Parallel(并行的) activities

    Autonomous components executing concurrent tasks
	- Participants can execute their own tasks in parallel, with little or no synchronisation
2. Communication via message passing

    No shared memory
	- With wide scale DS, there is no shared memory space to use as a ‘blackboard’. Instead, messages must be passed .
3. Resource sharing

    Printer, database, other services
	- We need to give ‘fair’ access to many users
4. No global state

    No single process can have knowledge of the current global state of the system
	- See message passing, can’t know all like on single PC
5. No global clock

    Only limited precision for processes to synchronize their clocks
	只有有限的精度用于同步其时钟
	- Can assume millesecond accuracy at best
