# Lecture 00 Overview

这是我在 COMP90015 Distributed Systems 课上做的一些笔记，包含重要的PPT内容以及一些个人的理解。同时对于 Assignment-1 和 Assignment-2 有一个简单的实现。

## 1. Course Information

* **Course:** [COMP90015 Distributed Systems](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90015) @ Semester 1, 2020
* **Instructor:** [Dr. Rajkumar Buyya](http://www.buyya.com/)
* **Tutor:** 
**感谢教学团队！** 

## 2. Subject Overview
- Part I: Foundations – approx. 5 weeks
    Introduction, Inter-process Communication, Socket and Thread Programming, and System Models
- Part II: Programming and Principles – 4 weeks
	1. Distributed Objects and Programming, 
	2. Operating System support services, Distributed Shared Memory Systems
- Part III: Paradigms（范式）/Platforms - 3 weeks:
	1. RMI, Kerberos, NFS etc. taught during Part I & II 
	2. Distributed File Systems, Security and Naming Services
- Guest Lectures / Advanced Topics (not in exam)
	CDN, Cloud, BlockChain, IoT, and industrial applications
- Depth of some parts may be reduced as the Dept. has dedicated subjects on some of these topics:
	Distributed Algorithms, Software Systems Security, Cluster and Cloud Computing, High-Performance Database Systems

## 3. Assignment 1-Single
- Multi-Threaded Dictionary Server
    Design and Implementation of a Simple Multi-Threaded Distributed System Supporting Access to a Remote Dictionary
- Aim:
	1. Enhance Understanding of Socket Programming and Multi-Threading
	2. Gain experience in implementing a simple distributed, client server application.
	3. “Using a client-server architecture, design and implement a multi-threaded server that returns the meaning of a word as stored in a remote dictionary.”
	4. Do some smart design/architecture (networking, storage)!
